- 👋 Hi, I’m @grolson1993
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about building apps for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and Android
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, C# and ++ although life is crazy and it's going a little slow
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing just yet, but hoping to soon learn enough to make a unity game that's kinda a throwback/loveletter to an old Mac game I played a lot as a kid, and drawing art isn't exactly my forte
- 📫 How to reach me ... Telegram or email: tennisinseattle@gmail.com
- Thanks for reading, hope to dive in to this community some more this summer! :D
